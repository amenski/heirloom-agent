/**
 * Streaming chunk → output-entry state machine (pure, no React).
 *
 * The agent streams text in arbitrary chunks. This module turns the chunk
 * stream into COMMITTED output entries while holding back what may still
 * rejoin later:
 *
 * - Inline paragraphs — an emphasis/code/strike span may close on a later
 *   streamed line (inlineSpanOpen), so the whole paragraph commits as ONE
 *   entry once closed; bold/code renders across newlines.
 * - List blocks — a wrapped item's continuation ("  text" under "- item")
 *   belongs to the same entry, so the renderer can bullet the item once and
 *   show the continuation beneath it instead of a bare literal line.
 * - Blockquote blocks — "> a\n> b" is one blockquote, so quote lines hold
 *   and commit together (the renderer draws a ▎ marker per line), and a span
 *   inside the quote can close across its lines.
 * - Fenced code blocks — content accumulates in the fence and commits as one
 *   entry at the closing fence.
 *
 * Block-enders (blank line, fence, heading, blockquote, horizontal rule) end
 * any held paragraph first — a span or list item can't cross one in CommonMark.
 * An unclosed span that never closes (e.g. literal "python **kwargs") is
 * bounded by MAX_HELD_LINES: after that many held lines the paragraph commits
 * as literal text rather than blocking the turn.
 *
 * The caller (App) applies bullets, blank-line separators, and queue batching.
