import type { PermissionRule } from "./rules.js";

/**
 * Default allow rules that make read-only exploration inside the working tree
 * free — no prompt for reading, listing, globbing, or searching files under
 * the project root. Mirrors Claude Code's model: the working directory is the
 * trust boundary, and reads within it are low-risk enough to not gate.
 *
 * PRECEDENCE (load-bearing safety property): these are applied ONLY as a
 * fallback when no other rule matched the subject — see resolveSubject. They
 * are deliberately NOT pooled with the specificity-ranked rules, so a
 * guarded secret-path rule (e.g. read_file "**\/.env*" → ask) always
 * pre-empts them: a guarded match makes matches.length > 0, and the fallback
 * is never consulted. A broad "./**" allow in the ranked pool would instead
 * out-specify the narrower guarded ask and silently allow reading secrets —
 * exactly the regression this structure avoids.
 *
 * search and glob's entries below are unconditional (kind "any" — no path
 * discrimination at all), unlike read_file/list_files' "./**" glob which
 * only matches paths lexically inside workingDir. That asymmetry is closed
 * by two mechanisms that also produce real matches (so this fallback is
 * still preempted the same way): the search-specific secret-path globs in
 * guarded.ts, and PermissionEngine.outOfWorkspaceGuardedRule, which
 * synthesizes a guarded "ask" match for any search/glob call whose `dir`/
 * `cwd` realpath-resolves outside workingDir. Both land in the
 * specificity-ranked pool before this fallback is ever consulted.
 *
 * origin "config" (not a new tier) keeps the rest of the engine — audit,
 * winningRule display, risk classification — treating these like any allow.
